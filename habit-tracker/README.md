# Simple Habit Tracker

Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click or open-file). The app runs fully offline and stores data in `localStorage`.

Features:
- 7-day habit tracker with per-day done/undo and a small chart
- Todo list with add/complete/delete
- Reminders (daily optional) that show notifications and play a short beep
- Single alarm setter and test notification

Notes:
- Allow browser Notifications when prompted for reminders/alarms to work.
- Best experience in a modern browser (Chrome/Edge/Firefox). On some browsers, `Notification` permission is required.

To run:
1. Open the file [C:/Navbar/habit-tracker/index.html](C:/Navbar/habit-tracker/index.html) in your browser.
2. Save a habit name, toggle days for the current week, add todos and reminders.
